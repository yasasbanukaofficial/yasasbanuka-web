# Personal Portfolio - Yasas Banuka V2 

This is a just a another version of my personal portfolio and it was been created with the theme on anime as you can see through the link 
https://yasasbanukaofficial.github.io/yasasbanuka-web/

Use this as you like make changes to this portfolio according to your preference but make sure to mention credits to me since this project took a lot of struggle to build since I'm a newbie around this time..

## Things you need to understand before using
- Should have an idea in using reactjs
- Should have an idea in using nextjs
- Learn about deploying nextjs project in github (Took me an hour to understand how the deploying process work, all the configuration and stuff)
- Learn how to use client side and server side rendering efficiently since it has been used in project.
- Learn about how to build static pages in next js using npm run build

That's It


TNX!!!
